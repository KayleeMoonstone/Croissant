      A croissant is a buttery, flaky viennoiserie pastry shaped like an
      Austrian kipferl but made using yeast-leavened laminated dough. Croissants
      are named after their historical crescent shape; the dough is covered with
      butter, rolled and folded multiple times, then rolled into a thin sheet
      using a technique known as laminating. The finished product has a layered,
      flaky texture akin to puff pastry.

      <br />
      Crescent-shaped breads and pastries have been manufactured since the
      Renaissance, and possibly since antiquity. Kipferls have long been a
      popular pastry in Austrian and French bakeries and p√¢tisseries. The
      contemporary croissant was created in the early twentieth century when
      French bakers replaced the kipferl's brioche dough with a yeast-leavened
      laminated dough. The invention of factory-made, frozen, premade but
      unbaked dough in the late 1970s transformed them into a fast food that
      could be freshly baked by unskilled labor.

      The croissant bakery, particularly the La Croissanterie brand, was a
      French answer to American-style fast food, and 30-40% of croissants served
      in French bakeries and patisseries in 2008 were prepared from frozen
      dough. Croissants are a popular feature of many European countries'
      continental breakfasts.

    <h2>The History</h2>
    <p>
      The kipferl, the precursor to the croissant, dates back to at least the
      13th century in Austria and appeared in a variety of shapes. Kipferl can
      be made simple or with nuts or other fillings (some people believe
      rugelach to be a type of kipferl). The croissant itself can be traced back
      to at least 1839 (some say 1838), when an Austrian artillery officer,
      August Zang, established a Viennese bakery ("Boulangerie Viennoise") at
      92, rue de Richelieu in Paris.

      This bakery, which sold Viennese specialties such as the kipferl and the
      Vienna loaf, quickly gained popularity and inspired French imitators (as
      well as the concept, if not the phrase, of viennoiserie, a 20th-century
      term for allegedly Vienna-style sweets). The crescent (croissant) shape of
      the French variant of the kipferl has become a globally recognisable shape
      around the world.
